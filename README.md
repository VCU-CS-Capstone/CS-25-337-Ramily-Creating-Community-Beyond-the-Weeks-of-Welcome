# *CS25-337 Project Description*
Freshmen and transfer students are seeking a deeper sense of belonging and community, as well as better connection to opportunities available during their time at VCU. Students shared that they felt overwhelmed having to figure out their academic, professional, and social lives all at once, especially in their first year at VCU. Students said that they also felt overwhelmed by the number of resources on campus. For example, students named 22 mobile apps that they had downloaded and used as they were trying to settle into life at VCU. da Vinci student teams proposed a homegrown, VCU mobile app that integrates key features from VCU Mobile (e.g., class schedule) and RamsConnect (e.g., student groups), and newly designed features aimed at enhancing studentsâ€™ sense of belonging at VCU. The ultimate impact being facilitating a deeper connection between students & campus environment, improved mental health & student academic success, and improved student retention.

## *Short Project Description*
The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others who will 
follow in your footsteps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project. 

## *Instructions*

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

    Flutter SDK

    Dart SDK

    Firebase CLI (if testing Firebase locally)

    An Android/iOS emulator or a physical device

### Install Dependencies

    Run the following command to install Flutter packages:

    >flutter pub get

### Set Up Firebase

    Go to Firebase Console

    Create a new Firebase project (or use an existing one)

    Add Android and iOS apps to the project

    Download the google-services.json (Android) and GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS) and place them in:

        android/app/google-services.json

        ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist

    Ensure your firebase_options.dart file is generated using the FlutterFire CLI:

    >flutterfire configure

### Run the App

    Make sure an emulator is running or a device is connected, then run:

    >flutter run

The app should now be running on your emulator or device. You should see the Login Screen as the default home page.
